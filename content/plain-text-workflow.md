# Plain text workflow

The basic workflow for working with plain text document formats involves both **input** (getting files into Markdown or similar format) and **output** (converting Markdown into other formats). It can be summarized as follows:

1. Create new plain text files or convert existing documents into plain text
2. Edit, process, and preview using any editing software or other program you prefer (or using a variety of tools, for example on the command-line)
3. Export to any other format as needed

In this workflow, the _canonical_ (reference) source of data is always the plain text format. If anything happens to one of the binary output files (e.g., data loss, file corruption, software becomes outdated or is unable to open the file anymore), just re-export or output to a different format. There is no lock-in and your content and data will always remain accessible to you and anyone you have shared it with.

## Input and output formats

* Input/storage formats: plain text (with or without markup)
* Output formats: PDF, HTML, EPUB, PowerPoint, .docx (Microsoft Word), .odt (OpenDocument word processing format), .odp (OpenDocument presentation format), Online slideshow, etc
