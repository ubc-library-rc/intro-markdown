[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is an all purpose "Swiss-army knife" for converting from one markup format to another. Apart from Markdown, it also supports loads of other input and output formats, so it is often the easiest way to go from plain text to rich output like word processing documents, presentations, slides, and PDFs.

It is a command-line tool, but you can also try it online: [here](https://pandoc.org/try/).
