<h2 id="setting-a-different-theme">Setting a different theme</h2>

<p>The quickest and easiest way to change your theme for this is to use the default “Theme Chooser” in Github under “Settings &gt; Github Pages” which comes with a small selection of well maintained default themes.</p>

<p>There is also a wide variety of other pre-made Jekyll themes to choose from on GitHub, which can be set up and installed using the same workflow (i.e., <strong>fork</strong> and <strong>publish</strong> on GitHub Pages) described in this workshop. For example, you can find a curated selection of free themes on <a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free">jekyllthemes.io</a>, and a much larger user-submitted list on <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">jekyllthemes.org</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to make more advanced changes on your own, you can do so by adjusting (or replacing) the CSS files included in your jekyll site.</p>

<p>You can also quickly and easily change the domain of your site to a custom domain that you have purchased elsewhere.</p>

<p>We  will not be going through this but Github has excellent documentation on <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site" target="_blank">managing custom domains for github pages sites</a>.</p>
